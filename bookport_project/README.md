## HarvardX CS50W: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript



### Distinctiveness and Complexity

- my project is an e-commerce website for selling books called bookport
- it's very different from project 2 :
      it has a very unique design and style
      it contains cart, checkout, categories
      it database is complex and big
      a completely new HTML and CSS
- it's mobile responsive
- it contains 5 models
- it contains two js files cart and index and 8 HTML templates
